# exit on error and option '-u' is used to give error for unset variables.

# $fx variables contain names with '*' or '?' characters. However, this option
# is used selectively within individual commands as it can be limiting at
# times.

# This is useful to automatically split file names in $fs and $fx properly
# since default file separator used in these variables (i.e. 'filesep' option)
# is newline. You need to consider the values of these options and create your
# commands accordingly.
